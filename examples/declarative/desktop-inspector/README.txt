This is a "desktop" inspector application for JsonDb.  It can be used
to view the JSON database while simultaneously running other
applications.

The column along the left allows you to show (green square) or hide
(red square) all objects of a certain type.  The text box allows you
to type in arbitrary queries, the results of which are then displayed.
Queries can also be saved for later use.
